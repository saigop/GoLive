# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for replacing Vimeo player with AWS Elemental media services in an event booking business application. The system will support multiple authentication flows, payment integration, and provide administrative controls for event management while maintaining the existing iframe-based architecture.

## Glossary

- **Elemental_Admin_App**: RESTful API-based administrative application for event setup and management
- **Video_Render_App**: React application that renders within iframe and handles registration, authentication, and payment flows
- **Event_System**: The complete media delivery and event management platform
- **Registration_Form**: Configurable form for user registration based on admin settings
- **Payment_Gateway**: Stripe API integration for processing payments
- **Access_URL**: Unique authenticated URL generated after successful payment
- **CloudFront_Distribution**: AWS CloudFront CDN for content delivery
- **DynamoDB_Store**: AWS DynamoDB database for storing event metadata and user data

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an event organizer, I want to create public events with no authentication required, so that users can access video content immediately without barriers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses a public event URL, THE Video_Render_App SHALL display the video content directly without requiring registration
2. THE Event_System SHALL track anonymous viewing analytics for public events
3. THE Elemental_Admin_App SHALL allow administrators to configure events as public with no authentication
4. THE Video_Render_App SHALL render video content using AWS Elemental media services instead of Vimeo player
5. THE Event_System SHALL maintain iframe compatibility for embedding in external websites

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an event organizer, I want to collect user email addresses for analytics tracking, so that I can understand my audience without requiring password authentication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses an email-only event, THE Video_Render_App SHALL display a registration form requesting email address
2. THE Registration_Form SHALL validate email format before allowing video access
3. THE Event_System SHALL store email registration data in DynamoDB_Store for analytics purposes
4. THE Video_Render_App SHALL set cookies for registered users to avoid repeat registration
5. WHEN email registration is complete, THE Video_Render_App SHALL grant immediate access to video content

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an event organizer, I want to secure premium events with password authentication, so that only authorized users can access paid content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers for a password-protected event, THE Event_System SHALL send a generic password via email
2. THE Video_Render_App SHALL display login form requiring email and password for access
3. THE Event_System SHALL validate credentials against DynamoDB_Store before granting access
4. THE Video_Render_App SHALL maintain user session through secure cookie management
5. IF authentication fails, THEN THE Video_Render_App SHALL display appropriate error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an event organizer, I want to integrate payment processing for paid events, so that users can purchase access to premium content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes registration for a paid event, THE Video_Render_App SHALL display Stripe payment interface
2. THE Payment_Gateway SHALL process payments without storing credit card details locally
3. WHEN payment is confirmed, THE Event_System SHALL generate a specialized Access_URL for the user
4. THE Event_System SHALL send the Access_URL to the user via email after successful payment
5. THE Video_Render_App SHALL validate Access_URL parameters before granting video access

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to configure registration forms dynamically, so that I can customize the user experience for different events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Elemental_Admin_App SHALL provide interface for creating configurable Registration_Form templates
2. THE Elemental_Admin_App SHALL allow administrators to set authentication type per event
3. THE Video_Render_App SHALL render Registration_Form based on configuration retrieved from Elemental_Admin_App
4. THE Elemental_Admin_App SHALL store event metadata and form configurations in DynamoDB_Store
5. THE Event_System SHALL support real-time form configuration updates without application restart

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to manage events through a centralized admin interface, so that I can efficiently set up and monitor multiple events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Elemental_Admin_App SHALL provide event creation and management interface
2. THE Elemental_Admin_App SHALL allow configuration of video sources using AWS Elemental media services
3. THE Elemental_Admin_App SHALL display analytics and registration data for each event
4. THE Elemental_Admin_App SHALL integrate with DynamoDB_Store for data persistence
5. THE Elemental_Admin_App SHALL provide API endpoints for Video_Render_App integration

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to maintain the existing iframe architecture, so that the new system integrates seamlessly with current implementations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Video_Render_App SHALL render within iframe containers on external websites
2. THE Video_Render_App SHALL communicate with Elemental_Admin_App through secure API calls
3. THE Event_System SHALL serve applications through CloudFront_Distribution for optimal performance
4. THE Video_Render_App SHALL parse query string parameters for event identification and user validation
5. THE Event_System SHALL maintain cross-origin communication capabilities for iframe integration

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want seamless video playback experience, so that I can enjoy content without technical interruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Video_Render_App SHALL integrate AWS Elemental media services for video delivery
2. THE Event_System SHALL provide adaptive bitrate streaming based on user connection
3. THE Video_Render_App SHALL handle video loading states and error conditions gracefully
4. THE Event_System SHALL support multiple video formats and resolutions
5. THE Video_Render_App SHALL maintain playback state and resume functionality where applicable
